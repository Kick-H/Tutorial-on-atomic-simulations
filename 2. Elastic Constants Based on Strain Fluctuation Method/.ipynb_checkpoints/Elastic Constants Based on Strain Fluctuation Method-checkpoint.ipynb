    "# Elastic Constants Calculations Based on Strain Fluctuations Method\n",
    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "- In this example, we calculate the elastic constants of diamond Si at 300 K and zero pressure. Based on the strain fluctuations method [[Parrinello 1982]](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.443248), one can directly measure the elastic constants from the fluctuations of unit cell vectors in the constant-stress (N, $\\sigma$, T) molecular dynamics simulations:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "C_{ijkl}^{-1} = \\frac{V}{k_{B}T}\\left\\langle\\epsilon_{ij}\\epsilon_{kl}\\right\\rangle-\\left\\langle\\epsilon_{ij}\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\epsilon_{kl}\\right\\rangle,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\epsilon$ is the unit cell strain, $V$ is the unit cell volume, $T$ is the temperature and $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant. $\\left\\langle\\right\\rangle$ represents the ensemble average and calculated as the the average over a period of time in molecular dynamics simulations. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this tutorial, we use the stochastic cell rescaling (scr) ensemble [[Bernetti 2020]](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0020514), which is a first-order barostat that samples the correct volume fluctuations by including a suitable noise term. The scr ensemble has been implemented in GPUMD recently. However, we stress that the strain fluctuation methods **cannot** be performed using **the Berendsen method**, due to the fact that the Berendsen method cannot give the correct volume fluctuations. "

    "Based on the [thermo.out](https://gpumd.zheyongfan.org/index.php/The_thermo.out_output_file) output files, according to the strain fluctuation method defined above, one can obtain the four-order elastic tensor based on fluctuation of corresponding strain compoments, and then obtain the two-order elastic constants under Voigt notation. Specifically, dimaond Si considered here has a cubic symmestry, there are only three elastic constants, i.e., C11, C12, C44. Based on this simple example, one can be easily extended to the structures with other symmetry.  "
