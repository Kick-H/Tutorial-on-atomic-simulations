# Tutorial-on-atomic-simulations
Here, we give some tutorials on atomic simulations based on [GPUMD package](https://github.com/brucefan1983/GPUMD).
1. The phonon participation ratios are calculated with the [GPUMD-2.9.1](https://github.com/brucefan1983/GPUMD/releases/tag/v2.9.1).
2. The elastic constants based on strain fluctuation method are calculated with the [GPUMD-3.0](https://github.com/brucefan1983/GPUMD/releases/tag/v3.0).
3. Phonon Dispersion and Vibration Mode Visualization of Graphene [GPUMD-2.9.1](https://github.com/brucefan1983/GPUMD/releases/tag/v2.9.1).
4. Quantum-corrected thermal conductivity of amorphous carbon [GPUMD-3.3](https://github.com/brucefan1983/GPUMD/releases/tag/v3.3).
